# 0.2.3

- vaccination dataset was changed again

# 0.2.2

- vaccination dataset was slightly changed yet again and the parser code required a column name change

# 0.2.1

- deleted shinyapp code - never got any updates and there are many good dashboards available

# 0.2.0

- simplified README to make maintenance more easy
- fixed `get_RKI_vaccination_timeseries()` after another change of the source dataset structure - this also forced a rename of the output columns
- three new columns for the `get_RKI_timeseries()` output after intense discussion in #47
